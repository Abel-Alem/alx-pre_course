# Create and setup Git and GitHub account

My first **ALX SE** project repo on github for the purpose of learning on how to create and setup a git and github environment.

Git is installed locally on my PC and i have signed up on Github and have an account. Projects im working on my local PC are being Pushed to the GitHub public repo.
